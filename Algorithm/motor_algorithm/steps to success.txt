1. Function for turning robot a certain angle deg (or a certain number of miliseconds)
1.5. Variable time input from serial to turn robot a certain angle deg (or a certain number of miliseconds)
2. Integrate LDR detection (Reading Unreliable)
3. Simulate motor with 4 LEDs.
4. When on ground (not tape), if is first turn, turn 45 deg. If second turn, turn -90 deg, if thrid turn 90 ...
5. (When the robot is ready) integrate algorithm to robot.

Tips:
Testing
When on black one wheel move, when on white the other wheel move
